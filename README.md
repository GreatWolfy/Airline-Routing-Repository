"For the Love of Travel"

This airline routing project is inspired by the little aviation geek inside of me (Jake Juliano) wanting to have a way to find and book flights with very niche specifications. The search and selection tools built into this engine will provide a much more detailed version of traditional booking engines. Such a search capability will hopefully enable booking more enjoyable flight paths and finding alternative options when traditional findings aren't satisfactory. Niche specifications will include choosing connecting airports, selecting aircraft types and specs, and customizing leg-specifc vs whole-trip details.
