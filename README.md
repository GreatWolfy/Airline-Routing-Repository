# Airline Routing Project
This project is inspired by the little aviation geek inside of me (Jake Juliano) wanting to have a way to find and book flights with very niche specifications. The search and selection tools built into this engine will provide a much more detailed version of traditional booking engines. Such a search capability will hopefully enable booking more enjoyable flight paths and finding alternative options when traditional findings aren't satisfactory.
